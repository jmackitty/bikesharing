# Bike Sharing Program

## Project Overview: 
The purpose of this project is to study the data available on NYC citi bike rides in order to try to replicate this kind of bike share system in Des Moines Iowa. There is a potential investor for the Des Moines bike share program and we need to provide visualizations so they can see how the bike share system will work why it should be implemented.


## Results: 
We have created a story in tableau that shows check out times for users based on gender, trips per weekday, trips per weekday by gender, as well as the peak hours in August. Based on the information we have, we can see that majoritiy of the trips are shorter trips, and that the majority of the bike share users are male. This user information will most likely be similar for a bike share program in Des Moines. Please see below for an illustration of the data.

## Summary:
The summary of this analysis based on the visualizations is that a ride share program in Des Moines should be successful. Most users will ride for 30 minutes or less between 7:00AM to 7:00PM. This seems to be a good way for tourists to get around the city and explore as well. There are higher demands during commuting hours, mornings from 7-8AM and evenings, 5-6PM, and males account for the most rides. The potential investors should see that there a huge opportunity for the bike sharing system in Des Moines.
